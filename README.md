>#### Question 1: (solution in question1.py)
>
>* *Program checks for lower case, upper case, special characters and numerals/digits to approve if the provide password is Strong, Weak or Poor.*
>![Password Case](q1_1.png)


>* *Special character check*
>
>![Special Character](q1_2.png)

>* *Entering a short password, or without numerals or special characters would make it weak*
>![Password Weak](q1_3.png)

>* *If you enter a password that satisfies all the conditions, then the password is strong*
>![Password Strong](q1_4.png)

`from colorama import Fore` # Install as mentioned in requirements.txt 
>* *Importing 'colorama' allows the program to display print statements in various colours, hence I used green color to be a strong password and red colour to warn that the password is poor*

>* *If the password satisfies 1 or no conditions it is considered a weak password*
>![Password Poor](q1_5.png)



#### Question 2: (solution in question2.py)

`import psutil`
> *Importing this allows the program to use the psutil module that accesses the hardward information such as CPU and RAM utilisation*

> *Program checks the CPU, RAM usage and number of Cores to give its usage percentage, runs continuously using a while statement, refreshes every 2.5 seconds*
![PSU Util](q2_1.png)

> *Tries to display timezone, since the module is not imported, it gracefully displays an alternate message. Also the program displays current date & time using the datetime module*
![Try and except](q2_2.png)

>* Displays that the CPU usage is Healthy
![Healthy](q2_3.png)

>* Displays that the CPU usage is Quite Healthy
![Medium Healthy](q2_4.png)

>* Displays the CPU usage is Poor, Warning!!
